    The problem is one of content. The misconception is that without deep content, design
  is reduced to pure style, a bag of dubious tricks. In graphic-design circles, form-follows-function
  is reconfigured as form-follows-content. If content is the source of form, always
  preceding it and imbuing it with meaning, form without content (as if that were even
  possible) is some kind of empty shell.
  The apotheosis of this notion, repeated ad nauseum (still!),is Beatrice Warde'sfamous
  <span class="rollover r-wine">Crystal Goblet metaphor</span>, which asserts that design (the glass) should be a transparent
  vessel for content (the wine). Anyone who favored the ornate or the bejeweled was a
  knuckle-dragging oaf. Agitators on both sides of the ideological spectrum took up the
  debate: minimalists embraced it as a manifesto; maximalists decried it as aesthetic
  fascism. Neither camp questioned the basic, implicit premise: it's all about the wine.This false dichotomy has circulated for so long that we have started to believe it
  ourselves. It has become a central tenet of design education and the benchmark
  against which all design is judged. We seem to accept the fact that developing content
  is more essential than shaping it, that good content is the measure of good design.
  Back when <span class="rollover r-paulrand">Paul Rand</span> wrote "There is no such thing as bad content, only bad form," I
  remember being intensely annoyed. I took it as an abdication of a designer's
  responsibility to meaning. Over time, I have come to read it differently: he was not
  defending hate speech or schlock or banality; he meant that the designer's purview is to
  the reason that modern designers—Rand, <span class="rollover r-bruno_munari">Munari</span>, Leoni—always seem to end their
  careers designing <span class="rollover r-book">children's books</span>. The children's book is the purest venue of the
  designer/author because the content is negligible and the evocative potential of the form unlimited.)?
  So what else is new? This seems to be a rather mundane point, but for some reason we
  don't really believe it. We don't believe shaping is enough. So to bring design out from
  under the thumb of content we must go one step further and observe that treatment is,
  in fact, a kind of text itself, as complex and referential as any traditional understanding
  of content.

  Bruno Munari (October 24, 1907, Milan – September 30, 1998, Milan) was an Italian artist, designer, and inventor who contributed fundamentals to many fields of visual arts (painting, sculpture, film, industrial design, graphic design) in modernism, futurism, and concrete art, and in non visual arts (literature, poetry) with his research on games, didactic method, movement, tactile learning, kinesthetic learning, and creativity.
