      Designers also trade in storytelling. The elements we must master are not the content
      narratives but the devices of the telling: typography, line, form, color, contrast, scale,
      weight. We speak through our assignment, literally between the lines.The span of graphic design is not a history of concepts but of forms. Form has evolved dramatically from one year to the next, and suggests a profession that continuallyrevises and reshapes the world through the way it is rendered. Stellar examples ofgraphic design, design that changes the way we look at the world, are often found in service of the most mundane content: an ad for ink, cigarettes, sparkplugs or machinery.Think of <span class="rollover r-PietZwart"> Piet Zwart </span> 's catalogues for electrical cable; or the travel posters of <span class="rollover r-Cassandre"> Cassandre </span> or Matter; or the New Wave work of Weingart, <span class="rollover r-GreimanandFreidman"> Greiman and Freidman </span>; or the punk incitations of Jamie Reid, in which the manipulation of form has an essential, even transformative, meaning.

      At a 1962 conference at the Museum of Modern Art, conservative art critic <span class="rollover r-Hiltonkramer"> Hilton Kramer </span> denounced Pop Art as "indistinguishable from advertising art" because "Pop Art does not tell us what it feels like to be living through the present moment of civilization. Its social effect is simply to reconcile us to a world of commodities, banalities and vulgarities." But perhaps the content of graphic design is exactly that: an evocation of "what it feels like to be living through the present moment of civilization," with all its "commodities, banalities and vulgarities." How else can we discuss the content of a
      typeface or why the typography of a surfing magazine suddenly becomes relevant? Or how a series of made-up or 'self-initiated' posters—already a medium of dubious functionality— can end up on the wall of a major design museum? Work must be saying something, which is different than being about something.
